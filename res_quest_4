"den del af filmen hvor han bare g\u00e5r rundt og er fattig og stort set laver ingenting g\u00e5r godt nok utrolig meget i tomgang og bliver meget kedelig. hvis man skal opleve hans kedsomhed og stillest\u00e5enhed s\u00e5 er missionen mere end vellykket"	1
"den er bare opbygget og fortalt virkelig tight og sp\u00e6ndende"	1
"den er virkelig smuk"	1
"den er virkelig vildt konstrueret."	1
"den fungerer lidt som en kolage som deles ind a tekststykker mellem scenerne - selvom der er et samlende narrativ gennem alle scenerne. den har virkelig mange fine passager. den var tangerende firre en halve p\u00e5 visse tidspunkter"	1
"den har virkelig mange sjove ting k\u00c3\u00b8rende for sig. v\u00c3\u00a6sentlig st\u00c3\u00a6rkere end den f\u00c3\u00b8rste. synes den l\u00c3\u00a5ner nogle ting fra moderne sitcom og er i almindelighed meget moderne i sit indhold s\u00c3\u00a5som netdating. at wifi g\u00c3\u00a5r i stykker mm"	1
"den havde nogle rigtig flotte skud"	1
"den havde nogle virkelig gode sceancer k\u00c3\u00b8rende for sig"	1
"den skulle have v\u00e6ret mindst 20 min kortere. alle 20 sk\u00e5ret fra fattigdomssekvensen hvor han bare g\u00e5r rundt."	1
"den spiller ikke efter de faste strukturer hvilket ellers kunne v\u00c3\u00a6re forventet. den puller heller ikke nogen lame tricks til alt for billige grin. er positivt overrasket over segels pen"	1
"den startede virkelig godt. han er genial med hans magtundergravende t\u00f8rre humor. men da historien begyndte at fylde for meget i anden halvdel af filmen gik det sjove desv\u00e6rre ud af filmen"	1
"den starter is\u00c3\u00a6r godt ud"	1
"den var meget langsom. men den havde nogle gode momenter og elementer i sig"	1
"den var sgu ret fin. den er s\u00c3\u00a5dan lidt fragmentarisk i det. en masse scener."	1
"den var slet ikke s\u00c3\u00a5 flot som hans forrige film. dramaet var ikke helt oppe at ringe men jeg m\u00c3\u00a5 indr\u00c3\u00b8mme de var lidt fangende"	1
